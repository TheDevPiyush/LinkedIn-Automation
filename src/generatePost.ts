Requirements:
- Should be specific enough to write a detailed post about
- Should be at intermediate difficulty level
- Should be current/relevant to 2024
- Should be something developers actually struggle with
- Return ONLY the topic title, nothing else

Examples of good intermediate topics:
- "Implementing JWT authentication with refresh tokens"
- "Designing a scalable caching strategy for microservices"
- "Building responsive layouts with CSS Grid and Flexbox"
- "Optimizing database queries for high-traffic applications"`;

  // Now create the engaging post about the generated topic
  const postPrompt = `Create an engaging LinkedIn post about "${generatedTopic}" that sounds like it's written by a real person, not AI. 

Requirements:
- Use a conversational, talkative tone like you're chatting with a friend
- Include relevant emojis throughout the post
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for key insights
- Make it feel personal and authentic
- Include a hook at the beginning to grab attention
- End with a question or call-to-action to encourage engagement
- Keep it between 800-1200 characters
- Use casual language, contractions, and real examples
- Avoid corporate jargon or overly formal language
- Focus on practical insights and real-world applications

CRITICAL: DO NOT include:
- Any links, URLs, or references to external resources
- Placeholder text like "[link to article]" or "[relevant resource]"
- Citations or references
- "Here are some resources" or similar filler content
- Hashtags (LinkedIn doesn't use them effectively)

The post should be completely self-contained with your own insights and experiences. Make it sound like someone who's genuinely excited to share insights and wants to start a conversation!`;
